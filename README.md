# CBTCIP â€” CipherByte Internship Projects

## Task 1 â€” Time Series Forecasting (Miles Traveled)
**Notebook:** `Task1_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb`  
**Dataset:** `Miles_Traveled.csv`

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs **time series forecasting** on monthly miles-traveled data using **ARIMA** and **Facebook Prophet** models.  
The aim is to build predictive models, compare performance using RMSE and MAE, and visualize predictions against actual data.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Task1_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb` â€” Google Colab-ready notebook with:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Visualization
  - ARIMA & Prophet model building
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Forecast plots
- `Miles_Traveled.csv` â€” Input dataset containing monthly miles traveled.
- `README.md` â€” This file.

---

### ðŸ›  How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload `Miles_Traveled.csv` when prompted.
3. Install Prophet in Colab:
   ```bash
   !pip install prophet


## Task 2 â€” Spam Email Detection

**Notebook:** `CBTCIP_Task2_SpamEmailDetection.ipynb`  
**Dataset:** `spam.csv`

---

### Project Overview
This project detects whether an SMS/email message is **spam or not** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and machine learning.  
The model is trained using the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** with ~5,500 labeled messages.

---

### Files Included
- `CBTCIP_Task2_SpamEmailDetection.ipynb` â€” Notebook with preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, Naive Bayes model training, evaluation metrics, and confusion matrix.  
- `spam.csv` â€” Dataset containing SMS messages labeled as `ham` or `spam`.  
- `README.md` â€” This file.

---

### How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Upload the dataset (`spam.csv`).  
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.  

---

### Results
- **Accuracy:** *fill after running*  
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** shown in classification report  
- **Confusion Matrix:** plotted for better visualization  

---

### Key Learnings
- Text preprocessing & cleaning  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Naive Bayes classification for text data  
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
